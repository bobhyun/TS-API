## v1.0.1

### LPR Event: Batch Plate Array (WebSocket)

Multiple plates recognized in a single frame are now delivered as one event with a `plates` array, instead of separate events per plate.

```json
{
  "topic": "LPR",
  "channel": 1,
  "image": "/storage/lpr/...",
  "plates": [
    {"plateNo":"12가3456","score":95,"srcCode":"A01",...},
    {"plateNo":"34나5678","score":88,"srcCode":"A02",...}
  ]
}
```

**Client compatibility** — handle both formats:
```javascript
const plates = data.plates || [data];
plates.forEach(p => console.log(p.plateNo, p.score));
```

> **Note**: This format applies to **v1 WebSocket** (`/wsapi/v1/events`) only. v0 WebSocket (`/wsapi/subscribeEvents`) continues to use the legacy single-plate format.

### Parking Spot Improvements (WebSocket)

- **Vehicle info always included**: `vehicle` field is now populated whenever plate data exists, regardless of parking lot registration.
- **Duplicate event fix**: A single recognition no longer triggers two `parkingSpot` events. Occupancy + vehicle data are combined into one event.

### Breaking Changes

None. All changes are backward compatible.
